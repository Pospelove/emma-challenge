I tried to go as simple as possible but take right desision based on Broker interface we have.

Feel free to use `.env` file to override chances. See `.env.example`
```
EMMA_REWARD_RANGE_3_10=95
EMMA_REWARD_RANGE_10_25=3
EMMA_REWARD_RANGE_25_200=2
```

Please don't be scared of the dynamic env names and the parsing code. I just thought it'd be funny :)
